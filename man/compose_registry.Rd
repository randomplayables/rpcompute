\title{Compose the compute registry}
\usage{
compose_registry()
}
\value{
A nested named list of handler functions.
}
\description{
Returns the registry (a nested list mapping \code{mode}/\code{fn} to handler
functions) used by the compute dispatcher. For now it returns only the
built-in registry; later we'll extend it to merge package/snippet registries.
}
\examples{
reg <- compose_registry()
is.list(reg$builtin)

}
