\title{Validate a compute request payload}
\usage{
validate_payload(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list representing the request body (already parsed from JSON).
Must contain at least components \code{mode} and \code{fn}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} on success; otherwise throws an error.
}
\description{
Minimal structural checks for the JSON body received by the compute API.
This is intentionally lightweight and will gain richer schema validation later.
}
\examples{
validate_payload(list(mode = "builtin", fn = "score_move"))

}
